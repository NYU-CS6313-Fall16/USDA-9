## Description

## Data Source
[USDA food composition](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list)

## Parallel coordinates
* It is the way of visualizing high-dimensional geometry and analyzing multivariate data.
* To show a set of points in an n-dimensional space, a backdrop is drawn consisting of n parallel lines, typically vertical and equally spaced, which represent each Nutrients. 
* A point in n-dimensional space is represented as a polyline with vertices on the parallel axes; the position of the vertex on the i-th axis corresponds to the i-th coordinate of the point, which give the amount (quantitative value) of the respective nutrient content.
